# Troubleshooting: ChatGPT Tool Visibility

## Error: "All tools are hidden. Make at least one tool public to use it in ChatGPT."

### Root Cause

ChatGPT Apps SDK reads tool descriptors via MCP `tools/list`. Each tool descriptor
must include proper `_meta` and `annotations` for ChatGPT to consider it "public."

When tools lack these fields, ChatGPT hides all of them.

### Required Fields on Each Tool Descriptor

1. **`_meta.ui.visibility`** — Controls whether ChatGPT (model) and/or the UI (app)
   can see the tool. Default is `["model", "app"]` but must be explicit.

   ```typescript
   _meta: {
     ui: { visibility: ['model', 'app'] },
   }
   ```

2. **`annotations`** — ChatGPT validates these during publishing. All three are required:

   | Annotation        | Type    | Purpose                                           |
   | ----------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
   | `readOnlyHint`    | boolean | Tool only reads/computes; no side effects         |
   | `destructiveHint` | boolean | Tool may delete/overwrite data                    |
   | `openWorldHint`   | boolean | Tool publishes content outside the user's account |

   Optional: `idempotentHint` (boolean) — repeated calls with same args are safe.

3. **`title`** — Human-readable tool name. Improves discoverability in the ChatGPT UI.

### Example (health tool)

```typescript
server.registerTool(
  'health',
  {
    title: 'Health Check',
    description: 'Check server and Supabase connectivity status',
    inputSchema: {},
    annotations: {
      readOnlyHint: true,
      destructiveHint: false,
      openWorldHint: false,
    },
    _meta: {
      ui: { visibility: ['model', 'app'] },
    },
  },
  async () => handleHealth(supabase),
);
```

### OpenAPI Spec (REST fallback)

If using the REST/Actions path instead of MCP, ensure:

1. Every operation lives under `paths -> /route -> method -> operationId`
2. `components.securitySchemes.BearerAuth` exists and is referenced
3. All `$ref` schemas resolve (e.g., `#/components/schemas/WriteCardsInput`)
4. `x-openai-isConsequential: true` on write operations

### Known Flakiness

ChatGPT Dev Mode has reported intermittent failures where valid tools are not picked up.
If tools are correctly annotated and still hidden, disconnect and reconnect the app in
ChatGPT settings. This is a known platform issue, not a server bug.

## Auth Consent Page: Cross-Tab Sign-In

The consent page now watches for Supabase auth session changes. If you sign in from another tab on the
same origin, the authorization page should auto-detect the new session and continue.

If auto-detection does not trigger, use the **"I signed in in another tab"** button to force a re-check.

The consent page also supports direct **email/password sign-in** via `signInWithPassword`, which is useful
when OAuth providers (Google/GitHub) are not configured on your Supabase project.

### Full Verification Checklist (MCP + OpenAPI)

1. **Confirm deployed version changed**
   - Set `SERVER_VERSION` to a new value for each tool-surface change.
   - Verify `GET /status` returns that `version`.
2. **Confirm OpenAPI is fresh**
   - `GET /openapi.json` should include all expected `/api/*` paths.
   - Response should include `Cache-Control: no-store`.
3. **Confirm MCP list is complete**
   - Connect to `/mcp`, initialize, then call `tools/list`.
   - Validate expected tools are present:
     - `health`
     - `write_cards`
     - `lookup_card_by_id`
     - `lookup_categories`
     - `lookup_projects`
     - `lookup_tags`
     - `search_cards`
4. **Confirm per-tool metadata**
   - Each tool has `title`, `annotations`, and `_meta.ui.visibility = ["model","app"]`.
5. **Refresh ChatGPT app connection**
   - Remove and reconnect if cache still shows stale tools.
